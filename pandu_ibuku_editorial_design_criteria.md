# Pandu Ibuku — Editorial Design Criteria

This document defines the **editorial design system** for *Pandu Ibuku*. It is not about technology or implementation, but about **how the website should feel, read, and behave visually**. All design decisions should serve clarity, calmness, and long-form thinking.

---

## 1. Editorial Design Positioning

Pandu Ibuku follows an **editorial-first design philosophy**.

The site should feel like:
- a personal thinking desk
- a serious reading space
- a place for slow, deliberate engagement

It should *not* feel like:
- a blog
- a media outlet
- a portfolio site
- a startup or innovation lab website

Design exists to **support reading and thinking**, not to impress.

---

## 2. Visual Personality

**Core attributes**
- Calm
- Restrained
- Rational
- Warm but serious
- Timeless

**Avoid**
- Trend-driven UI styles
- Decorative elements
- Visual noise
- Aggressive calls to action

If a visual element does not improve readability or structure, it should be removed.

---

## 3. Color System

The color system must be extremely limited.

**Primary background**
- Warm white or off-white (not pure white)

**Primary text**
- Near-black / charcoal (avoid pure black)

**Secondary text**
- Softer gray for metadata (dates, categories)

**Accent color (very limited use)**
- Deep navy OR muted dark blue
- Used only for links, subtle dividers, or emphasis

**Rules**
- No gradients
- No bright colors
- No multiple accent colors
- Color should never compete with text

---

## 4. Typography System

Typography is the most important design element.

### 4.1 Body Text (Primary Reading Font)

Requirements:

- Comfortable for older readers
- Neutral, not decorative

**Recommended direction**
- Serif or humanist serif
- Traditional but modern

Examples of suitable characteristics:

- Open counters
- Generous x-height

Font size should be slightly larger than default web standards.

---

### 4.2 Headings

Requirements:
- Clear hierarchy
- Calm authority
- No stylistic exaggeration

Recommended direction:
- Same family as body text (preferred), or
- A restrained humanist sans-serif if contrast is needed

Avoid bold, condensed, or display-style fonts.

---

### 4.3 Metadata & UI Text

Used for:
- Dates
- Section labels
- Navigation

Characteristics:

Never use decorative fonts for UI text.

---

## 5. Layout & Reading Structure

### 5.1 Page Layout

- Single-column layout for reading
- Generous margins on left and right
- Maximum readable line length (avoid very wide text blocks)

The layout should encourage slow reading and re-reading.

---

### 5.2 Content Hierarchy

Each article page should follow this rhythm:
1. Title
2. Short opening paragraph
3. Main body text
4. Gentle closing or reflection

Avoid sidebars, widgets, or competing content areas.

---

## 6. Navigation Design

Navigation should be:
- Minimal
- Always accessible
- Non-distracting

Primary navigation items:
- Home
- Pandu Bangsaku
- Prime Numbers, Numbers & Logic
- Akhlak Mulia
- Creative Notes
- Innovation for Mobility
- About

Navigation should never overpower the reading experience.

---

## 7. Logo & Identity

### 7.1 Logo Philosophy

The logo for *Pandu Ibuku* should be:
- Typographic
- Text-based
- Calm and understated

Avoid symbols, icons, or graphic marks.

The name **“Pandu Ibuku”** itself is the identity.

---

### 7.2 Logo Usage

- Logo appears as text in the header
- Uses the same typeface as headings or body text
- No separate logo lockup required

This reinforces the idea that **ideas, not branding, are central**.

---

## 8. Imagery & Diagrams

### 8.1 General Imagery Rules

- Use images only when they clarify thinking
- Never use images as decoration
- Avoid stock photography

---

### 8.2 Diagrams & Sketches

Especially for *Innovation for Mobility*:
- Prefer line drawings
- Neutral backgrounds
- Simple visual language
- Sketch-like or technical notebook style

Images should feel like working material, not marketing visuals.

---

## 9. Interaction & Behavior

### 9.1 Comments

- Comments are allowed
- Visually subdued
- No social-media styling

Discussion should feel like written correspondence, not live chat.

---

### 9.2 Feedback Signals

Avoid:
- Likes
- Shares
- Counters
- Popularity indicators

The site values thoughtfulness over engagement metrics.

---

## 10. Design Principles Summary

Every design decision should pass this test:

- Does this improve reading?
- Does this reduce distraction?
- Does this respect the reader’s attention?

If the answer is no, remove it.
